Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
Ans: Data structure gives the coding purpose and decipline.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Ans: Compiler Design, Operation System, Database Management System,
Statistical Analysis Package...

what is an Array?
Ans: A container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.


what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
Ans: Difference between array and ArrayList in java include eight points namely Resizable, Performance, Traversal,
Primitives, Length, Type-Safety, Adding elements, Multi-dimensional.

what is LinkedList?
Ans: A linked list is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object. Each element (we will call it a node)
of a list is comprising of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last node has a reference to null.
The entry point into a linked list is called the head of the list.

what is queue?
Ans: Queue interface is a subtype of the java.util.Collection interface. It represents an ordered list of objects just like a List,
but its intended use is slightly different. A queue is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue, and elements removed
from the beginning of the queue.

what is stack?
Ans: A stack is a data structure that allows data to be inserted (a 'push' operation), and removed (a 'pop' operation). Many stacks also
support a read ahead (a 'peek' operation), which reads data without removing it. A stack is a LIFO-queue, meaning that the last data to be
inserted will be the first data to be removed.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
Ans: FIFO is a contraction of the term "first in, first out," and means that the goods first added to inventory are assumed to be the first
goods removed from inventory for sale. LIFO is a contraction of the term "last in, first out," and means that the goods last added to inventory
are assumed to be the first goods removed from inventory for sale.

what is the order of complexity?
Ans: The most common metric for calculating time complexity is Big O notation. This removes all constant factors so that the running time can be
estimated in relation to N as N approaches infinity.

what is the best case to search an element from an array?
Ans: 

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Ans: 

what is tree in data structure?
Ans: a tree is a widely used abstract data type (ADT)—or data structure implementing this ADT—that simulates a hierarchical tree structure,
with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

what is graph in data structure?
Ans: A set of items connected by edges. Each item is called a vertex or node. Formally, a graph is a set of vertices and a binary relation
between vertices, adjacency.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
Ans: 1)HashTable is synchronized whereas HashMap is not.
2)Another difference is that iterator in the HashMap is fail-safe while the enumerator for the HashTable isn't. If you change the map while
iterating, you'll know.
3)HashMap permits null values in it, while HashTable doesn't.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
Ans: 

How HashMap works in java?
Ans: When we call put method, hashcode() method of the key object is called so that hash function of the map can find a bucket location to store
value object, which is actually an index of the internal array, known as the table.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
Ans: All array accesses are checked at run time; an attempt to use an index that is less than zero or greater than or equal to the length of the
array causes an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException to be thrown.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
Ans: System.arraycopy
[name of array].clone
Arrays.copyof()

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
Ans: In array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address of elements
is stored in the link part of previous element/node. In array, no pointers are used like linked list so no need of extra space in memory for pointer.

What is DFS and BFS?
Ans: DFS: Distributed File System (DFS) is a set of client and server services that allow an organization using Microsoft Windows servers to organize
many distributed SMB file shares into a distributed file system.
BFS: he aim of BFS algorithm is to traverse the graph as close as possible to the root node. Queue is used in the implementation of the breadth first search.

What is Recursion?
Ans: Recursion is a basic programming technique you can use in Java, in which a method calls itself to solve some problem. A method that uses this technique
is recursive. 

What is Big-(O)-notation?
Ans: Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
Ans: 

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
