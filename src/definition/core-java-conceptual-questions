Please answer the below core-java Questions:


What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
Ans:Java development kit, It includes the jre, a compiler(javac),a loader, archiver, documentation generator.

What is IDE?
Ans: Integrated development environment is a software suite that consolidates the basic tools developers need to write and test software. 

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
Ans: Eclipse, NetBeans, JCreator, Processing, BlueJ, intellij.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Ans: Editor passes through.Java source file, java compiler compiles the code and outputs to .class bytecode file with help of java libraries,
gets passed onto JVM, which is ran by an operating system with machine code by the host machine. 

what is class?
Ans: Class is a blueprint or template for creating different objects which defines its properties and behaviors. 

What is object?
Ans: Objects are the instances of a class which defines the behavior. 

What is the entry point of an application?
Ans: Entry point is where processor enters a program or a code fragment and execution begins.

Why main is static?
Ans: Main is static because it can be directly invoked by the class and objects are not must.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Ans:interface vs abstract. multiple vs single inheritance. no data member vs data member. 
no constructors vs constructors. no access modifier vs yes. member of interface cant be 
static vs complete members can. 

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
Ans: No, you can a have a class implements that Interface or Abstract class. 

what is Access Specifier?
Ans: 'public', 'private', are access specifier that defines what information can be accessed.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
Ans: OOP is object oriented programming, consists of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
Encapsulation: hiding data for better data management and hiding implementation. 
Inheritance: Acquiring the features of a parent class. 
Polymorphism: Data overloading with passing unit type of data/different combinations. 

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
Ans: List of java application programming interface. It provides functionality to developer. 

Does java support multiple inheritance?
Ans: yes

What is method overloading and when it happens?
Ans: Method overloading is used to increase the readability of the program, and it happens in the Compile time. 

What is method overriding and when it happens?
Ans: Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of the method that is already provided by its super class, and it happens in the Run time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
Ans: Exceptions occur when normal flow of program is interrupted and error message is
generated. exceptions can be handles with try catch block or some mathematical exceptions can be handled with if else block. 

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
Ans: When a variable is declared with the keyword static, its called a class variable. All instances share the same copy of the variable.
A class variable can be accessed directly with the class, without the need to create an instance.
It is a method which belogns to the class and not to the object(instance). A static method can access only static data. It can not access
non-static data (instance variable). A static method can call only other static methods and can not call a non-static method from it.
A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn't need any object

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
Ans: final variable is used to finalize a variable and not be able to change it after, 
final methods are something that cant be overridden when it gets called by a sub class and
gets inherited. 

What is final, finally and finalize?
Ans: Final: Apply restricitons on a class, method or variable,Keyword. finaly: place 
important code that will be executed whether exception is handled or not, Finalize: Perform
clean up processing just before object is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
Ans: Specialized method without the return type, that initialize the object.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
Ans:It can be used inside the Method or constructor of Class. It(this) works as a reference to
the current Object whose Method or constructor is being invoked. The this keyword can be used
to refer to any member of the current object from within an instance Method or a constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java?
Ans: Super refers to the variable of a variable parent class, invokes constructor or method
of immediate parent class. 

What is JVM stand for ?
Ans: Java Virtual Machine. 

What version of java are you using?
Ans: Java 8 

What is JAR stand for ?
Ans: Java Archive

What is compile time and run time?
Ans: The source code must be compiled into machine code in order to become and executable program.
This compilation process is referred to as compile time.(think of a compiler as a translator)
A compiled program can be opened and run by a user. When an application is running, it is called runtime.

What is heap?
Ans: Heap is java runtime data area from which memory for all class instances are allocated.

How java manage it's memory?
Ans:thread stacks and native handles are allocated in memory separate from the heap, as well 
as JVM internal data structures. The heap is sometimes divided into two areas (or 
generations) called the nursery (or young space) and the old space. The nursery is a part 
of the heap reserved for allocation of new objects. When the nursery becomes full, garbage 
is collected by running a special young collection, where all objects that have lived long 
enough in the nursery are promoted (moved) to the old space, thus freeing up the nursery 
for more object allocation. When the old space becomes full garbage is collected there, a 
process called an old collection. The reasoning behind a nursery is that most objects are 
temporary and short lived. A young collection is designed to be swift at finding newly 
allocated objects that are still alive and moving them away from the nursery. Typically, a 
young collection frees a given amount of memory much faster than an old collection or a 
garbage collection of a single-generational heap (a heap without a nursery).
